## Summary

**EquityJamii** is an android app that **will host Kenya's Equity Bank programs and social events. It will access its YouTube Channel videos which can be played by the app users**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üòÄüëèüëç**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [x] Made a recycler view of YouTube videos whose cardviews' length and width are programmatically responsive to screen size

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **YouTube Data API V3**.
